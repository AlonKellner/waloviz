* **Q:** I got an error: ``RuntimeError: Couldn't find appropriate backend to handle uri my.wav and format None.`` Why?

  .. collapse:: A:

      | WaloViz uses ``torchaudio`` to load audio files, and ``torchaudio`` itself uses a beckend to load them, the recommended backend is ``ffmpeg``, so just make sure you've installed it:
      
      .. code-block:: shell 
        
        apt-get install ffmpeg

* **Q:** How can I help WaloViz?
