**WaloViz is an open-source interactive audio player with a spectrogram built-in, as a Jupyter widget or as HTML.**

| Welcome!
| WaloViz is an open source audio player with a spectrogram built-in, it was built by audio experts - for audio experts.
| To start using WaloViz right now - read our `Getting Started Guide <./getting-started.html>`_.
| WaloViz is proudly using Bokeh and the HoloViz stack for most of its features (as indicated by our name). To learn more - go to `the Bokeh website <https://bokeh.org/>`_ and `the HoloViz website <https://holoviz.org/>`_, they're great :)

Why WaloViz?
------------

| WaloViz is designed to be accessible but powerful.
| With just three lines of code it integrates seamlessly with the most popular notebook IDEs such as JupyterLab, VSCode and Google Colab.
| You can use it to view audio URLs and files but also your own processed audio tensor.
| An impressive suite of features is at your fingertips, high-level features such as overlaying your data and a built-in download button, and also low-level features for granular control like changing the colormap or sample-rate.
|
| WaloViz is open-source and proud of its community!
| With so many benefits, the real question becomes why not?
