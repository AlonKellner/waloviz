**WaloViz is an open-source interactive audio player with a spectrogram built-in, as a Jupyter widget or as HTML.**

| Welcome!
| WaloViz is an open source audio player with a spectrogram built-in, it was built by audio experts - for audio experts.
|
| The name comes from ``WaloViz = wav + HoloViz``, since it supports common audio file formats such as ``wav`` and many others thanks to ``torhcaudio`` and ``ffmpeg`` , and it is interactive thanks to the high customizability of the ``HoloViz`` stack, integrated with ``Bokeh``.
| To learn more about ``HoloViz`` - go to `the HoloViz website <https://holoviz.org/>`_, to learn more about ``Bokeh`` - go to `the Bokeh website <https://bokeh.org/>`_, they're great :)
|
| To start using WaloViz right now - read our `Getting Started <./getting-started.html>`_ guide.
| You can also try ``waloviz`` right now with our `Google Colab Demo <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1euQCxaNlTg0pGvXz6d7RSoDhM3B1k7dy?usp=sharing>`_ :)

Why WaloViz?
------------

| WaloViz is designed to be accessible but powerful.
| With just three lines of code it integrates seemlessly with the most popular notebook IDEs such as JupyterLab, VSCode and Google Colab.
| You can use it to view audio URLs and files but also your own processed audio tensor.
| An impressive suite of features is at your fingertips, high-level features such as overlaying your data and a built-in download button, and also low-level features for granular control like changing the colormap or sample-rate.
|
| WaloViz is open-source and proud of its community!
| With so many benefits, the real question becomes why not?
