## The Very First Contribution

Thank you for wanting to contribute to WaloViz!  
There is one way in which you can contribute that takes only one second:  
:star2: **Please consider giving WaloViz a GitHub star** :star2:

Even if you do not give a star, you are the best!  
Using WaloViz, telling a friend about it or making contributions are all amazing ways in which WaloViz can become more useful for more people.  
For that we are greatful :heart:

## What is a Good First Contribution?

The best place to start contributing to WaloViz is always the [Good First Issues](https://github.com/AlonKellner/waloviz/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%3Agood-first-issue)!  
These are issues tagged with the `good-first-issue` tag, and you should be able to tackle them without any prior knowledge.

But before you go ahead and start working on a PR you should read our [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md) first.

## Can I Contribute more?

**YES!**  
WaloViz is early on its path, and there are lots of ways in which it can become better.  
Here is a not comprehensive list of possible Contributions:

- **Read the Vision & Roadmap** - find them in the [Readme](README.md), you might be able to help in ways that we didn't even realize!
- **Improve the Documentation** - It is the highest priority
- **Write Tests** - Second only to Documentation
- **Automate processes** - Anything from bots to github actions, your knowledge can help WaloViz save precious time
- **Create an Issue** - before jumping straight into creating PRs, create an Issue that explains your reasoning\problem to the community
- **Comment\Upvote an Issue** - We'd love to hear your opinion on open Issues! We will listen
- **Solve an Issue with a PR** - after you actively engaged with the Issue in the comments and were given the PR responsibility
- **Talk with the community** - your engagement **is** the community, as long as it adheres to our [Code Of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
